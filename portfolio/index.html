				<p><a href="http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-social-office" target="_blank">Social Office</a> is a social collaboration platform built on top of Liferay. The goal of the product is to streamline communication within enterprises with groups and sites that empowers users to work together easily.</p>

				<p>The following mockups were conceived and prototyped during off work hours and free time. I began designing the next generation of Social Office in mid 2013. This design of Social Office introduced the <em>&#8220;User Bar&#8221;</em> a new way to navigate through Liferay.</p>

				<p>Upon building the initial mockups for the next generation of Social Office, I built a proof of concept theme that showcased the new look and feel and prototyped a functional User Bar within it. It introduced the company to a better navigational scheme. The User Bar in itself is user centric and is easily identifiable within the interface globally.</p>
