					<h2>A Little About Me</h2>

					<p>I have a <em>no-nonsense</em> approach to work, and I <strong>love</strong> to get things done. I move quick, work smart, prototype efficiently, and produce results.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;ve been designing, prototyping, and implementing user interfaces for over 7 years. I&rsquo;ve done front-end development for various Fortune 500 companies, some with over 20,000 unique pageviews a day.</p>

					<p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I&rsquo;m either making something or riding my bicycle. You can find out more about about my adventures on my <a href="http://www.instagram.com/aarondelani">Instagram</a> account.</p>
